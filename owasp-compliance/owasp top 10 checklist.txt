WEEK 6 REPORT
Project: Juice Shop Security Audits & Deployment
Intern: Muhammad Ali Kashif
Week: 6 – Advanced Security Audits & Final Deployment

------------------------------------------------------------
GOAL:
Conduct advanced security audits, ensure compliance with industry standards, 
and prepare the application for secure deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASKS COMPLETED:

1. Security Audits & Compliance
   - Conducted security audits using:
       * OWASP ZAP – tested all endpoints and common vulnerabilities
       * Nikto – scanned the web server for outdated components and misconfigurations
       * Lynis – audited the server system for security compliance
   - Checked compliance with OWASP Top 10 best practices

2. Secure Deployment Practices
   - Enabled automatic security updates and dependency scanning
   - Followed Docker security best practices:
       * Scanned container images using Trivy
       * Updated vulnerable libraries
       * Ensured secrets are not hardcoded
   - Verified security fixes applied for critical vulnerabilities (vm2 sandbox escape, OpenSSL, etc.)

3. Final Penetration Testing
   - Performed penetration tests using Burp Suite
   - Documented vulnerabilities, test results, and applied improvements
   - Fixed exposed private keys, JWT tokens in frontend/backend

------------------------------------------------------------
SECURITY FINDINGS (Sample)

- Trivy Docker Image Scan:
  * Total vulnerabilities: 23 (Unknown:0, Low:12, Medium:7, High:3, Critical:1)
  * Examples:
    - libc6 CVE-2026-0861 (HIGH) – Heap corruption risk
    - libssl3 CVE-2025-15467 (CRITICAL) – RCE or DoS via Initialization
    - vm2 package vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-32314 (CRITICAL) – Sandbox escape
  * Secrets discovered and fixed:
    - Asymmetric Private Key in /juice-shop/lib/insecurity.ts
    - JWT tokens in frontend spec files

- OWASP ZAP & Nikto scans:
  * Tested for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and security misconfigurations
  * Applied mitigations for vulnerabilities found

------------------------------------------------------------
SECURE DEPLOYMENT:

- Docker Image updated and rescanned with Trivy
- Dependency updates applied (npm packages, system libraries)
- Sensitive files removed or secured
- Automatic updates enabled on server

------------------------------------------------------------
OWASP TOP 10 CHECKLIST:

| #   | Category                                       | Checked? | Notes / How Tested |

| A04 | Insecure Design                               | ✔        | Reviewed code design and authentication logic |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration                     | ✔        | Nikto & ZAP scanned server; fixed misconfigurations |
| A06 | Vulnerable and Outdated Components           | ✔        | Trivy scan completed; updated vulnerable libraries |
| A07 | Identification and Authentication Failures   | ✔        | Login, password reset, and JWT tested |
| A08 | Software and Data Integrity Failures         | ✔        | Verified Docker image integrity and secure updates |
| A09 | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures     | ✔        | Logs verified for suspicious actions |
| A10 | SSRF / Other Vulnerabilities                  | ✔        | API endpoints tested; URL validation ensured |

------------------------------------------------------------
